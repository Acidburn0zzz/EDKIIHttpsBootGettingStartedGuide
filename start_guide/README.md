# Start Guide {#start-guide}

This guide gives instructions on how to set up a UEFI HTTPS Boot environment for both IPv4 and IPv6 network environments. This section assumes the reader has [installed EDK II](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Getting-Started-with-EDK-II), and can build and run the NT32 simulator. The NT32 simulator serves as the UEFI HTTPS client.
